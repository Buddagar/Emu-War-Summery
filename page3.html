	<h1 class="Center1"> Summery of the War</h1>
	<p class="regular-text"> Because of Migrating National birds, a veteran general and his group of friends decide to stop the crop destroying birds with guns.
It does not go well, and people begin to dissent until promised bounties on the birds. The fervor this invoked was mainly due to the lowering
value of the british pound dragging down the australian pound. With more attention focused on him, <br> the Major Meridith somehow managed
to screw up even more, endangering the lives of his "soldiers" in a driving experiment. environmentalists Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittel
used <br> the power of the pen to end the war, stating that the Emu, being the national bird, was to be protected, even as it cost the farmers thousands of Dollars. This worked, and the war ended. </p>
