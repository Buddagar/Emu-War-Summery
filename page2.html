	<h1 class="Center1"> Effects in the war.</h1>
	<p class="regular-text"> Many things happened in the Emu war, and after reading the causes you know why the war started, and
this page will explain what happened. </p>
<p class="regular-text"> <strong>The first effect </strong> in the Emu War was the Emus <span class="effect">destroyed the farmers fences</span>. They did this because they were migrating north and needed food.
<br><strong>The seconed effect </strong> is that, with the fences to farms broken, <span class="effect"> australian wildlife now attacked the farms </span>
<br><strong> The third effect</strong> was that the australian major Meridith started a war with the Emus to prevent further damages. 
This, however, did not go as planned, as his first attack against the Emus was with a camera crew and 2 machine gunners. The cameras succesfully filmed them killing a "Number" of birds (between 4 and 10) out of the herd of 300.
<br> <strong>This 4th effect </strong> Caused many to believe he was incompetent, until bounties on the birds, with as many as 200 pounds per bird were offered. This changed peoples minds very quickly. <br>
In order to regain some of his reputation, Major meridith came up with a new strategy. one gunner would drive a jeep at the brds, while someone in the back fired at them. This plan was quickly <br> failed after the 1st attempted resulted in the driver landing in a ditch and the gunner unable to hit moving birds from a moving vehicle.
<br><strong> The resulting effect</strong> was that environmentalists Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittel, among others, began to call out against this war against the national bird. The war was then, at an end, with around 30 Emus killed out of an entire country.</p>
